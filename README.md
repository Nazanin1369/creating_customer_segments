Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  

>**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown cells can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

## Getting Started

In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in *monetary units*) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

The dataset for this project can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers). For the purposes of this project, the features `'Channel'` and `'Region'` will be excluded in the analysis — with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.

Run the code block below to load the wholesale customers dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.


```python
# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import renders as rs
from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames

# Show matplotlib plots inline (nicely formatted in the notebook)
%matplotlib inline

# Load the wholesale customers dataset
try:
    data = pd.read_csv("customers.csv")
    data.drop(['Region', 'Channel'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
    print "Wholesale customers dataset has {} samples with {} features each.".format(*data.shape)
except:
    print "Dataset could not be loaded. Is the dataset missing?"
```

    Wholesale customers dataset has 440 samples with 6 features each.


## Data Exploration
In this section, you will begin exploring the data through visualizations and code to understand how each feature is related to the others. You will observe a statistical description of the dataset, consider the relevance of each feature, and select a few sample data points from the dataset which you will track through the course of this project.

Run the code block below to observe a statistical description of the dataset. Note that the dataset is composed of six important product categories: **'Fresh'**, **'Milk'**, **'Grocery'**, **'Frozen'**, **'Detergents_Paper'**, and **'Delicatessen'**. Consider what each category represents in terms of products you could purchase.


```python
# Display a description of the dataset
display(data.describe())
```

### Implementation: Selecting Samples
To get a better understanding of the customers and how their data will transform through the analysis, it would be best to select a few sample data points and explore them in more detail. In the code block below, add **three** indices of your choice to the `indices` list which will represent the customers to track. It is suggested to try different sets of samples until you obtain customers that vary significantly from one another.


```python
# TODO: Select three indices of your choice you wish to sample from the dataset
indices = [157, 211, 358]

# Create a DataFrame of the chosen samples
samples = pd.DataFrame(data.loc[indices], columns = data.keys()).reset_index(drop = True)
print "Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:"
display(samples)
```

    Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:

### Question 1
Consider the total purchase cost of each product category and the statistical description of the dataset above for your sample customers.  
*What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples you've chosen represent?*  
**Hint:** Examples of establishments include places like markets, cafes, and retailers, among many others. Avoid using names for establishments, such as saying *"McDonalds"* when describing a sample customer as a restaurant.

**Answer:**

The first thing I notice is that the mean values and median values differ a lot. That means the distribution should not be a normal distribution. In such a case, median is considered to be more reiable than mean.

For the 1st sample, it has higher costs on "Fresh", and "Frozen" than the median. The "Fresh" cost is outstandingly high. I think it is a restaurant. (The word "restaurant" does not appear in the question, but appears in the description of the dataset in UCI Machine Learning Repository. So I think it's reasonable to believe there is a restaurant establishment.)

For the 2nd sample, it has higher costs on every category. The "Grocery" cost is especially high. I think it is a supermarket.

For the 3rd sample, it has higer costs on "Milk", "Fronzen", and "Delicatessen". The costs on "Milk" and "Delicatessen" are especially high. I believe it is a cafe.

### Implementation: Feature Relevance
One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign `new_data` a copy of the data by removing a feature of your choice using the `DataFrame.drop` function.
 - Use `sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split` to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Use the removed feature as your target label. Set a `test_size` of `0.25` and set a `random_state`.
 - Import a decision tree regressor, set a `random_state`, and fit the learner to the training data.
 - Report the prediction score of the testing set using the regressor's `score` function.


```python
for col in list(data.columns.values):    
    # Make a copy of the DataFrame, using the 'drop' function to drop the given feature
    new_data = data.drop(col, axis=1)

    # Split the data into training and testing sets using the given feature as the target
    from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(new_data, data[col], test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

    # Create a decision tree regressor and fit it to the training set
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
    regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=0)
    regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Report the score of the prediction using the testing set
    score = regressor.score(X_test, y_test)
    print("{} R^2 score: {:2f}".format(col ,score))
```

    Fresh R^2 score: -0.333071
    Milk R^2 score: 0.173438
    Grocery R^2 score: 0.699248
    Frozen R^2 score: -0.278249
    Detergents_Paper R^2 score: 0.348777
    Delicatessen R^2 score: -11.023628


### Question 2
*Which feature did you attempt to predict? What was the reported prediction score? Is this feature is necessary for identifying customers' spending habits?*  
**Hint:** The coefficient of determination, `R^2`, is scored between 0 and 1, with 1 being a perfect fit. A negative `R^2` implies the model fails to fit the data.

**Answer:**
Based on R^2 scores above, it seems that Delicatessen, Fresh and Frozen are important for identifying customers' spending habits, since the model couldn't fit trying to predict them using the others.


### Visualize Feature Distributions
To get a better understanding of the dataset, we can construct a scatter matrix of each of the six product features present in the data. If you found that the feature you attempted to predict above is relevant for identifying a specific customer, then the scatter matrix below may not show any correlation between that feature and the others. Conversely, if you believe that feature is not relevant for identifying a specific customer, the scatter matrix might show a correlation between that feature and another feature in the data. Run the code block below to produce a scatter matrix.


```python
# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of features in the data
pd.scatter_matrix(data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
```


![png](output_15_0.png)



```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns = data.keys()).reset_index(drop = True)
sns.set(rc={"figure.figsize": (14, 8)});

# plot clustermap
sns.clustermap(df)

```


![png](output_16_0.png)


### Question 3
*Are there any pairs of features which exhibit some degree of correlation? Does this confirm or deny your suspicions about the relevance of the feature you attempted to predict? How is the data for those features distributed?*  
**Hint:** Is the data normally distributed? Where do most of the data points lie? 

**Answer:**

The pairs below exhibit correlation, which confirms my suspicions about their relevance, as they have the top 3 R^2 score of the decision tree regressor, it's also to be noted that their distributions are skewed to the right, thus a log scale could be useful in this case.

* Milk & Detergents_Paper
* Grocery and Milk
* Frozen & Delicatessen

Also Data is not normally distributed since Mean and Median are vary significanty.

## Data Preprocessing
In this section, you will preprocess the data to create a better representation of customers by performing a scaling on the data and detecting (and optionally removing) outliers. Preprocessing data is often times a critical step in assuring that results you obtain from your analysis are significant and meaningful.

### Implementation: Feature Scaling
If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most [often appropriate](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/02/use-of-logarithms-in-economics) to apply a non-linear scaling — particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign a copy of the data to `log_data` after applying a logarithm scaling. Use the `np.log` function for this.
 - Assign a copy of the sample data to `log_samples` after applying a logrithm scaling. Again, use `np.log`.


```python
# TODO: Scale the data using the natural logarithm
log_data = np.log(data)

# TODO: Scale the sample data using the natural logarithm
log_samples = np.log(samples)

# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of newly-transformed features
pd.scatter_matrix(log_data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
```


![png](output_21_0.png)


### Observation
After applying a natural logarithm scaling to the data, the distribution of each feature should appear much more normal. For any pairs of features you may have identified earlier as being correlated, observe here whether that correlation is still present (and whether it is now stronger or weaker than before).

Run the code below to see how the sample data has changed after having the natural logarithm applied to it.


```python
# Display the log-transformed sample data
display(log_samples)
```

### Implementation: Outlier Detection
Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many "rules of thumb" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use [Tukey's Method for identfying outliers](http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/highlighting-outliers-in-your-data-with-the-tukey-method/): An *outlier step* is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to `Q1`. Use `np.percentile` for this.
 - Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to `Q3`. Again, use `np.percentile`.
 - Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to `step`.
 - Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the `outliers` list.

**NOTE:** If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points!  
Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored in the variable `good_data`.


```python
# For each feature find the data points with extreme high or low values
for feature in log_data.keys():
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q1 (25th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q1 = np.percentile(log_data[feature], 25)
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q3 (75th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q3 = np.percentile(log_data[feature], 75)
    
    # TODO: Use the interquartile range to calculate an outlier step (1.5 times the interquartile range)
    step = 1.5*(Q3-Q1)
    
    # Display the outliers
    print "Data points considered outliers for the feature '{}':".format(feature)
    display(log_data[~((log_data[feature] >= Q1 - step) & (log_data[feature] <= Q3 + step))])
    
# OPTIONAL: Select the indices for data points you wish to remove
outliers  = [128, 65, 66, 75, 154]

# Remove the outliers, if any were specified
good_data = log_data.drop(log_data.index[outliers]).reset_index(drop = True)

```

### Question 4
*Are there any data points considered outliers for more than one feature? Should these data points be removed from the dataset? If any data points were added to the `outliers` list to be removed, explain why.* 

**Answer:**

Yes, 128, 65, 66, 75, 154.They should be removed since they affect more than one feature.

The outliers that affect more than one features will likely change the assumption of the data like the variance and the clustering of the data like the mean of the cluster. For the outliers involving delicatessen which have no relationships to the other features, including the outliers can cause the clustering algorithm to classify relationships that is only caused by a few outliers.

For outlier 65 & 75 which involve frozen and fresh. These 2 features have some relationship, the outlier can possibly cause the clustering algorithm to not find any relationship between them. The outlier can also move the mean of the cluster to an unreasonable place.

Removing outliers can have an impact on the PCA since outliers that create relationships that are not present may affect the decisions of the PCA algorithm hence affecting the number of observable clusters after applying PCA to the data.

## Feature Transformation
In this section you will use principal component analysis (PCA) to draw conclusions about the underlying structure of the wholesale customer data. Since using PCA on a dataset calculates the dimensions which best maximize variance, we will find which compound combinations of features best describe customers.

### Implementation: PCA

Now that the data has been scaled to a more normal distribution and has had any necessary outliers removed, we can now apply PCA to the `good_data` to discover which dimensions about the data best maximize the variance of features involved. In addition to finding these dimensions, PCA will also report the *explained variance ratio* of each dimension — how much variance within the data is explained by that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be considered a new "feature" of the space, however it is a composition of the original features present in the data.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Import `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` and assign the results of fitting PCA in six dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of the sample log-data `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.


```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
# TODO: Apply PCA to the good data with the same number of dimensions as features
pca = PCA(n_components=6)

# TODO: Apply a PCA transformation to the sample log-data
pca_samples = pca.fit(good_data).transform(log_samples)

# Generate PCA results plot
pca_results = rs.pca_results(good_data, pca)
print pca_results['Explained Variance'].cumsum()
```

    Dimension 1    0.4430
    Dimension 2    0.7068
    Dimension 3    0.8299
    Dimension 4    0.9311
    Dimension 5    0.9796
    Dimension 6    1.0000
    Name: Explained Variance, dtype: float64



![png](output_30_1.png)


### Question 5
*How much variance in the data is explained* ***in total*** *by the first and second principal component? What about the first four principal components? Using the visualization provided above, discuss what the first four dimensions best represent in terms of customer spending.*  
**Hint:** A positive increase in a specific dimension corresponds with an *increase* of the *positive-weighted* features and a *decrease* of the *negative-weighted* features. The rate of increase or decrease is based on the indivdual feature weights.

**Answer:**

The first and second principal component captures 44.3% + 26.4% = 70.7% of the total variance. 

The first 4 components captures 44.3% + 26.4% + 12.3% + 10.1% = 93.1% of the total variance.

The 1st principal component shows that it increases with Detergents_Paper(about 0.76), milk(0.4) and grocery(0.43). However frozen(-0.2) and fresh(-0.18) seems to decrease slightly with an increase of the 1st principal component. The customers int his dimension may be in the desert restaurant industry.

The 2nd principal component shows that all the features increases with it but fresh(0.7), delicatessen(0.47) and frozen(0.48) increases significantly with compare to the others. The customers in this dimension could be food procesing factory where they process raw food and package it.

The 3rd principal component shows that fresh(-0.7) significantly decrease and delicartessen(0.6) significantly inscrease with the increase of this principal component. Frozen(0.3) moderately increases and detergents_paper(-0.25) moderately decreases with the increase of this principal component while the rest remains relatively unchange. The customers in this dimension could be ruuning a butchery that sells delicatessen too.

The 4th principal component shows that frozen(0.78) significantly increase and delicatessen(0.55) moderately decrease with the increase of this principal component. There is also a slight increase in detergent_paper(0.2) and decrease in fresh(-0.2). The customers in this dimension could be a butchery because they buy a lot of frozen.

### Observation
Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it in six dimensions. Observe the numerical value for the first four dimensions of the sample points. Consider if this is consistent with your initial interpretation of the sample points.


```python
# Display sample log-data after having a PCA transformation applied
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = pca_results.index.values))
```

### Implementation: Dimensionality Reduction
When using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data — in effect, reducing the complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the *cumulative explained variance ratio* is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign the results of fitting PCA in two dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `good_data` using `pca.transform`, and assign the reuslts to `reduced_data`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of the sample log-data `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.


```python
# TODO: Fit PCA to the good data using only two dimensions
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca.fit(good_data)

# TODO: Apply a PCA transformation the good data
reduced_data = pca.transform(good_data)

# TODO: Apply a PCA transformation to the sample log-data
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Create a DataFrame for the reduced data
reduced_data = pd.DataFrame(reduced_data, columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2'])
```

### Observation
Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it using only two dimensions. Observe how the values for the first two dimensions remains unchanged when compared to a PCA transformation in six dimensions.


```python
# Display sample log-data after applying PCA transformation in two dimensions
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2']))
```

## Clustering

In this section, you will choose to use either a K-Means clustering algorithm or a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data. You will then recover specific data points from the clusters to understand their significance by transforming them back into their original dimension and scale. 

### Question 6
*What are the advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm? What are the advantages to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm? Given your observations about the wholesale customer data so far, which of the two algorithms will you use and why?*

**Answer:**

**K-Means clustering algorithm properties**
* Simple algorithm
* Low capability to pass the local optimum
* Hard clustering, data points belong to only one cluster
* Assumes uniform distribution
* Scales to very large data sets
* Assumes spherical cluster shape

**Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm properties**
* Can get stuck in local minimum
* Soft clustering, data points have probability to be in a cluster
* Assumes Gaussian distribution
* Not scalable
* Assumes elliptical cluster shape

I will use Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm, given that the distribution of the features after scaling them is gaussian and not a uniform distribution.the Gaussian Mixture Model seems more suitable since it assumes the same distribution, it's also more flexible since it assumes elliptical cluster shape, as opposed to spherical shape.

Also the small size of the data set makes it possible to use GMM, otherwise K-means would have been the practical choice.

### Implementation: Creating Clusters
Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data — if any. However, we can quantify the "goodness" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Fit a clustering algorithm to the `reduced_data` and assign it to `clusterer`.
 - Predict the cluster for each data point in `reduced_data` using `clusterer.predict` and assign them to `preds`.
 - Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to `centers`.
 - Predict the cluster for each sample data point in `pca_samples` and assign them `sample_preds`.
 - Import sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score and calculate the silhouette score of `reduced_data` against `preds`.
   - Assign the silhouette score to `score` and print the result.


```python
# Apply your clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data 
from sklearn.mixture import GMM
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
#clusterer = KMeans(n_clusters = 2, random_state=45)
clusterer = GMM(n_components = 2, random_state=45, covariance_type="spherical")
clusterer = clusterer.fit(reduced_data)


# Predict the cluster for each data point
preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data)

# Find the cluster centers
#centers = clusterer.cluster_centers_
centers = clusterer.means_

# Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point
sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)

# Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
score = silhouette_score(reduced_data, preds, random_state=43)
print("Silhouette score: {:2f}".format(score))
```

    Silhouette score: 0.423837


### Question 7
*Report the silhouette score for several cluster numbers you tried. Of these, which number of clusters has the best silhouette score?* 

**Answer:**

* For n_components: 2 the score is: 0.423837
* For n_components: 3 the score is: 0.400324
* For n_components: 4 the score is: 0.337403
* For n_components: 5 the score is: 0.297096
* For n_components: 6 the score is: 0.335050
* For n_components: 7 the score is: 0.354717

Total cluster 2 has the best score

### Cluster Visualization
Once you've chosen the optimal number of clusters for your clustering algorithm using the scoring metric above, you can now visualize the results by executing the code block below. Note that, for experimentation purposes, you are welcome to adjust the number of clusters for your clustering algorithm to see various visualizations. The final visualization provided should, however, correspond with the optimal number of clusters. 


```python
# Display the results of the clustering from implementation
rs.cluster_results(reduced_data, preds, centers, pca_samples)
```


![png](output_47_0.png)


### Implementation: Data Recovery
Each cluster present in the visualization above has a central point. These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data, but rather the *averages* of all the data points predicted in the respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a cluster's center point corresponds to *the average customer of that segment*. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from these data points by applying the inverse transformations.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Apply the inverse transform to `centers` using `pca.inverse_transform` and assign the new centers to `log_centers`.
 - Apply the inverse function of `np.log` to `log_centers` using `np.exp` and assign the true centers to `true_centers`.



```python
# TODO: Inverse transform the centers
log_centers = pca.inverse_transform(centers)

# TODO: Exponentiate the centers
true_centers = np.exp(log_centers)

# Display the true centers
segments = ['Segment {}'.format(i) for i in range(0,len(centers))]
true_centers = pd.DataFrame(np.round(true_centers), columns = data.keys())
true_centers.index = segments
print("True Centers")
display(true_centers)
print("Comparred to the mean")
display(np.round(true_centers - data.mean()))
print("Comparred to the median")
display(np.round(true_centers - data.median()))
```

    True Centers

### Question 8
Consider the total purchase cost of each product category for the representative data points above, and reference the statistical description of the dataset at the beginning of this project. *What set of establishments could each of the customer segments represent?*  
**Hint:** A customer who is assigned to `'Cluster X'` should best identify with the establishments represented by the feature set of `'Segment X'`.

**Answer:**

Segment 0 has Fresh, Frozen and Delicatessen below median and mean, while Milk, Grocey and Detergents paper above, this could represent retailers.

Segment 1 could represent cafes or restaurants, given that all its features are below the mean, and all of them also below the median except Fresh and Frozen.


### Question 9
*For each sample point, which customer segment from* ***Question 8*** *best represents it? Are the predictions for each sample point consistent with this?*

Run the code block below to find which cluster each sample point is predicted to be.


```python
# Display the predictions
for i, pred in enumerate(sample_preds):
    print "Sample point", i, "predicted to be in Cluster", pred
```

    Sample point 0 predicted to be in Cluster 1
    Sample point 1 predicted to be in Cluster 0
    Sample point 2 predicted to be in Cluster 1


**Answer:**

By comparing the segments description to the samples,
"Segment 0 has Fresh, Frozen and Delicatessen below median and mean, while Milk, Grocey and Detergents paper above, this could represent retailers.
Segment 1 could represent cafes or restaurants, given that all its features are below the mean, and all of them also below the median except Fresh and Frozen."

"sample 0 has total cost below the mean and median for all features except for fresh, which indicates it might be a cafe
As for sample 1 it has total cost below the median and mean for all the features except Frozen and Delicatessen, so it might be a restaurant.
And for sample 2, its high costs for Fresh, Milk, Grocery (higher than the mean and median), so it could be a market."

Since sample 0 have costs below the mean except for fresh, it's closer to segment 1 which is also below the mean except for Fresh and Frozen.

Sample 1 also has total cost below the median and mean for all the features except Frozen and Delicatessen, so it belongs to segment 1.

As for sample 2, it has high costs for Fresh, Milk, and Grocery, and this is close to segment 0 as it also has high Milk and Grocery, so it belongs to segment 0.

This matches the prediction of the algorithm.

## Conclusion

### Question 10
*Companies often run [A/B tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) when making small changes to their products or services. If the wholesale distributor wanted to change its delivery service from 5 days a week to 3 days a week, how would you use the structure of the data to help them decide on a group of customers to test?*  
**Hint:** Would such a change in the delivery service affect all customers equally? How could the distributor identify who it affects the most?

**Answer:**

Based on the structure and segmentation of the customer the test should be done on customers from the first segment as they are more likely to be cafes or hotels and their consumption is considered less, while the other segment has much higher consumption reducing the delivery service days could be harmful for them.

### Question 11
*Assume the wholesale distributor wanted to predict a new feature for each customer based on the purchasing information available. How could the wholesale distributor use the structure of the data to assist a supervised learning analysis?*  
**Hint:** What other input feature could the supervised learner use besides the six product features to help make a prediction?

**Answer:**

Currently we have a new engineered feature which is customer segment that would indicate to some extent if the customer would be negatively affected by changing the schedule or not, this can be used in new data set along with the existing features, so a classifier can use them all to determine if changing the schedule would affect the customer negatively or not.

### Visualizing Underlying Distributions

At the beginning of this project, it was discussed that the `'Channel'` and `'Region'` features would be excluded from the dataset so that the customer product categories were emphasized in the analysis. By reintroducing the `'Channel'` feature to the dataset, an interesting structure emerges when considering the same PCA dimensionality reduction applied earlier on to the original dataset.

Run the code block below to see how each data point is labeled either `'HoReCa'` (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or `'Retail'` the reduced space. In addition, you will find the sample points are circled in the plot, which will identify their labeling.


```python
# Display the clustering results based on 'Channel' data
rs.channel_results(reduced_data, outliers, pca_samples)
```

### Question 12
*How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers? Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution? Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments?*

**Answer:**

The algorithm had silhouette score of 0.423837, where the score ranges from -1 to 1, high value indicates that a point that is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters, also it did well for the three samples chosen matching my previous definition for the segments.
